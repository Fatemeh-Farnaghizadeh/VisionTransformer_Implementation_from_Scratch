# Implementing Vision Transformer (ViT) from Scratch in PyTorch for Flower Classification

Welcome to the Flower Classification project where we'll build and train a Vision Transformer (ViT) model from scratch in PyTorch. This repository contains the code and instructions to guide you through the process of creating a custom Flower Classification model using ViT.

## Getting Started

Follow these steps to set up your environment and run the code:

### Clone the Repository
To begin, clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Fatemeh-Farnaghizadeh/VisionTransformer_Implementation_from_Scratch.git
cd VisionTransformer_Implementation_from_Scratch
```
### Download Dataset
You will need to download the flower dataset to train and test your model. You can obtain the dataset from this [link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17HpTij-vL6Obg_Jcz7G74Qzboj4p5UUq/view?usp=sharing).

### Set Up Virtual Environment
To ensure that you have all the necessary dependencies and avoid conflicts with your system-wide Python packages, it's recommended to create a Python virtual environment. Follow these steps:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
### Run the Code
You can now execute all the code.
